0,"The bombshell 20-page letter written by Donald Trump’s attorneys to special counsel Robert Mueller early this year and obtained by The New York Times Saturday includes an intriguing revelation. Trump “dictated” the misleading statement about Donald Trump Jr.’s controversial meeting with a Russian representative during the presidential election, the letter states unequivocally.

Donald Trump Jr. met at Trump Tower in Manhattan in June 2016 with Kremlin-linked attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, who said she could deliver damaging information on Hillary Clinton.

After the Times reported on the Trump Tower meeting last summer, “The president dictated a short but accurate response ... on behalf of his son,” stated the newly obtained letter, written by Trump’s attorneys Jay Sekulow and John Dowd (who has since left the Trump legal team).

The president’s response stated that the meeting “primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children.” It omitted any mention of Clinton.

Veselnitskaya did mention the Magnitsky Act that deals with Russian adoptions, but the focus of the meeting was Clinton, according to Trump’s son.

The misleading statement could cause problems for Trump if it’s seen as an attempt to obstruct Mueller’s investigation into possible Russia collusion with his campaign.

It could also cause problems for Trump’s son, who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last September that he didn’t have a clear idea who was responsible for the misleading statement about Russian adoptions.

Trump’s authorship of the problematic response — confirmed for the first time by his own attorneys — was an intriguing aside in the letter whose key point was arguing that Trump is essentially legally untouchable because he is the president. He can’t be compelled to testify in the Mueller investigation, and has the power to shut down any Justice Department probe and pardon whomever he wants, according to the memo.

“Indeed, the President not only has unfettered statutory and Constitutional authority to terminate the FBI director,” the letter states. “He also has Constitutional authority to direct the Justice Department to open or close an investigation, and, of course, the power to pardon any person before, during, or after an investigation and/or conviction.”

It’s a position that legal experts have already attacked (check out the video above)."
1,"The president scored cheap political points this morning by undermining trust in the U.S. economy. A president who is obsessed with stopping leaks leaked extremely sensitive economic information about May’s jobs report Friday morning, over an hour before the report was officially released.

“Looking forward to seeing the employment numbers at 8:30 this morning,” President Donald Trump tweeted at 7:21 a.m., hinting the numbers would be favorable. Not only is that an hour before the report’s release, it’s a full two hours before government appointees are legally allowed to say anything at all. side from the sheer hypocrisy of Trump, one, leaking and, two, playing up the importance of a report he used to dismiss as “phony” and “one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics,” it also makes for deeply problematic economic policy.

That’s according to Justin Wolfers, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan and an adviser to the Congressional Budget Office, among other things. Wolfers said the president’s disclosure is unprecedented both in the U.S. and among his counterparts in other developed countries. And it’s unprecedented for a handful of really, really good reasons:

Trump is making America Greek again (i.e., bad things happen when data is politicized).
It’s extremely important that the data we use to determine how healthy the economy is remain totally independent and free from political influence. Trump teasing and putting a political spin on numbers ahead of their release casts doubt on whether they’re accurate and honest.

The data in these reports are the result of countless hours of work by a group Wolfers characterized as “nerds in basements.” Markets trust number-crunching nerds who work for government agencies that operate above the political fray. They don’t trust politicians.

“The reason for that is, in many tin-pot countries, autocrats start fiddling with the statistics,” Wolfers said. “When they start doing that, no one believes them, and you end with a situation like in Greece, where nobody wants to loan you money.”

“The original sin that led to the Greek crisis is that they were dishonest with their economic statistics,” Wolfers added. “This is a step toward undermining that. There’s nothing good at the end of that pathway.” It’s illegal and undermines fundamental trading rules.
A fundamental principle of the economy is the ideal that everyone has access to the same information as everyone else. Information that could send markets skyrocketing, plummeting or even staying the course is tightly guarded, and doled out in a manner meant to ensure everyone has equal access.

Trump was one of a highly select group of people briefed on the jobs report ahead of time. By tweeting about it prior to its release, he turned the system on its head ? and that’s illegal.

“If any public official under any previous administration had issued that tweet, they would get fired within the hour,” Wolfers said.

Former President Barack Obama’s onetime chief economic adviser Austan Goolsbee told Politico, “If the president just tipped that the numbers are good, he broke the law.” 

Anyone armed with extra information ? say a friend Trump told while chatting on the phone Thursday night, or someone who saw Trump’s tweet at just the right moment ? can use it to make a lot of money at someone else’s expense.

“If someone makes money in a casino, someone else is losing it,” Wolfers explained, “and that’s likely yours and my retirement account.”

Wolfers hasn’t yet been able to dig into Friday’s pre-market data and conclusively say that’s what happened after Trump tweeted, but he said at first glance it’s “highly suggestive.”

“If you’re a financial market trader and you saw that tweet and you were aware the president has been briefed on the numbers, you’d have to be a fool to not know what was up,” he said. “Traders with millions on the line are doing something.”

Illegality aside, it’s just bad for the economy.
“It’s clear the president doesn’t take his responsibility to treat confidential data seriously,” said Wolfers. “Now every time he speaks we’re going to be wondering, ‘Did we just learn something?’ And if he sounds optimistic, we’ll buy, and if he sounds pessimistic, we’ll sell.

“That’s extra volatility we don’t need.”

In addition to destabilizing the market, Trump’s tweet undermines the White House’s own ability to send legitimate economic signals when they actually matter.

“There are times when the White House needs to speak and be understood,” Wolfers said. “All of this confuses the White House’s message, not in the political sense, but in the economic sense.”

So in the future, if Trump’s economic adviser recommends broadcasting a message that seeks to either boost or cool down the markets, for example, economists may disregard the signal seeing it as Trump crying wolf.  

“When it’s time,” Wolfers warned, “the markets will respond less than they should.”"
2,"The late-night host has apologized for using an expletive to refer to Ivanka Trump. Bee called Ivanka Trump a “feckless cunt” on Wednesday’s episode of “Full Frontal” while making a joke about how the first daughter is complicit in the president’s immigration policies.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called the comment “vile and vicious” on Thursday and asked TBS and Time Warner to discipline the late-night host. 

Both Bee and TBS later apologized for the language used. 

“I would like to sincerely apologize to Ivanka Trump and to my viewers for using an expletive on my show to describe her last night,” Bee said in a statement sent to HuffPost. “It was inappropriate and inexcusable. I crossed a line, and I deeply regret it.” 

Trump previously tweeted about entertainment news earlier this week when he shared his thoughts on ABC canceling Roseanne Barr’s show. Trump did not comment on Barr’s racist statement that led to the cancellation of her sitcom. Instead, he tweeted that he was disappointed he had not received a call from Bob Iger, CEO of the Walt Disney Company, about “the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC.”  

In his tweet Friday, the president appeared to refer to the controversy over Barr’s racist remarks, calling it “a total double standard.”

Trump publicly demanding that a private company fire an individual over comments with which he disagrees is similar to how White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders suggested last year that ESPN should fire host Jemele Hill, after Hill referred to Trump as “a white supremacist.”
President Donald Trump responded Friday to Samantha Bee’s controversial comments about his daughter Ivanka Trump, demanding that the comedian and host of “Full Frontal” be fired."
3,"Trump’s Steel Tariffs Incite Retaliation From Mexico And Canada. MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico hit back fast on U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum on Thursday, targeting products from congressional districts that President Donald Trump’s Republican party is fighting to retain in November elections.

Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said the tit-for-tat measures would complicate talks between the United States, Canada and Mexico to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that underpins trade between the neighbors.

The spat meant it would be “very difficult” to reach a deal to revamp NAFTA before Mexico’s July 1 presidential election, though he underlined the continent had not entered a trade war.

“A trade war is when there is an escalation of conflict. In this case, it is simply a response to a first action,” Guajardo told Mexican radio. “We should stick to the clearly defined battlefield, where the response is appropriate and proportional.”

Mexico’s retaliatory tariffs target pork legs, apples, grapes and cheeses as well as steel - products from U.S. heartland states that supported Trump in the 2016 election.

The country reacted right after Washington said in the morning it was moving ahead with tariffs on aluminum and steel imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union.

“It sends a clear message that this kind of thing does not benefit anybody,” Guajardo said of the Mexican retaliation.

“Because, in the end, the effect will fall on voters and citizens that live in districts where the people have a voice and vote in the (U.S.) Congress.”

Mexico said it was imposing “equivalent” tariffs, ratcheting up tensions during talks to renegotiate NAFTA ahead of the U.S. mid-term elections in November. The measures will be in place until the U.S. government drops its tariffs, Mexico’s government said. MEXICO WITH THE WORLD

Guajardo said retaliation was aimed at products chosen to hit districts with important lawmakers who had been warning Trump not to mess with Mexico. He estimated the U.S. tariffs would affect $4 billion in trade between the two countries.

“It is a sad day for international trade,” Guajardo said. “But hey, the decision was made, and we always said that we were going to be ready to react.”

In 2011, Mexico successfully used a similar list of mostly agricultural products to push Washington into letting Mexican truckers on U.S. highways.

Trump’s Republicans are fighting to retain control of Congress in mid-term elections. Their majority in the House of Representatives is seen as vulnerable.

Pork exporter Iowa, where incumbent Republican Rod Blum faces a Democratic challenge, is an example of a place Mexico’s reaction could hurt.

Mexico buys more steel and aluminum from the United States than it sells. It is the top buyer of U.S. aluminum and the second-biggest buyer of U.S. steel, Guajardo’s ministry said.

The countermeasures will hit U.S. hot and cold rolled steel, plated steel and tubes, the ministry said.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto spoke by phone after the U.S. announcement. Canada pledged to fight back with its own measures.

Trump threatened to rip up the NAFTA deal during his election campaign but agreed to renegotiate early in his term. Still, since talks began nine months ago, he has repeatedly said he could walk away from NAFTA if it is not redone to his liking.

“The difference between a year and four, five months ago is that it seems the world looked and said ’poor Mexico,” Guajardo said. “Now, Mexico is facing these threats together with the world.”

4,"The president had thoughts on how ABC handled the situation, but he said little about Roseanne Barr’s racist remarks."
5,"President Donald Trump on Wednesday threw Attorney General Jeff Sessions under the bus again, tweeting that he wished he had picked someone else to lead the Justice Department. 

Trump referred to Rep. Trey Gowdy’s (R-S.C.) Wednesday appearance on “CBS This Morning,” in which he defended the president’s frustration with Sessions’ decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe.

“I would be frustrated, too,” Trump quoted Gowdy as saying. “There are lots of really good lawyers in the country, he could have picked somebody else!”

Trump added: “And I wish I did!” Sessions, an early supporter of Trump’s 2016 presidential run, has been the subject of Trump’s ire since he announced his recusal in March 2017 from a federal investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. 

Despite Trump’s public humiliation campaign against Sessions, he reportedly rejected an offer from Sessions to resign last spring.

The Justice Department declined to comment.

Although Trump seemed to embrace Gowdy’s comment Wednesday, the Republican lawmaker has previously criticized Trump’s use of Twitter to bash Sessions. 

“Doing this publicly, I don’t think helps our justice system,” Gowdy said in July 2017 after Trump attacked a “beleaguered” Sessions on Twitter for not investigating Hillary Clinton.

“I think you ought to praise in public and critique in private,” Gowdy said. “You shouldn’t make personnel decisions, particularly at the Cabinet level, via Twitter. ... The attorney general doesn’t work for the president. He works for a blindfolded woman holding a set of scales.”

During an appearance Tuesday on Fox News, Gowdy contradicted Trump’s recent claims that the FBI “spied” on his campaign under the orders of President Barack Obama.

Gowdy, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said the FBI acted appropriately when it used an informant to gather information about Trump’s campaign advisers who allegedly had suspicious contacts linked to Russia.

“I am even more convinced that the FBI did exactly what my fellow citizens would want them to do when they got the information they got, and that it has nothing to do with Donald Trump,” Gowdy said on Fox News."
6,"President Donald Trump never misses an opportunity to claim credit where none is due or to center himself among America’s national rituals ? especially where the military is concerned. On Memorial Day, Trump tweeted praise for the nation’s fallen soldiers, adding that those who gave their lives for America would be especially happy to learn that the economy was doing well under his administration.

Trump’s promotion of compulsory nationalism and patriotism explains his support for the National Football League’s new national anthem policy, announced last week and in direct response to the pressure he has put on the NFL.

The League will now fine a team if a player refuses to stand and show “respect” for the flag and anthem, while permitting players to stay in the locker room during the anthem if they choose. Exercising one’s First Amendment rights by protesting racial inequality and police violence against black communities is acceptable, the NFL seems to think, as long as it’s done off camera and out of public view. Mandatory displays of patriotism are now the name of America’s game.

In response to the new policy, Trump told Fox News, “You have to stand — proudly — for the national anthem or you shouldn’t be playing. You shouldn’t be there. Maybe you shouldn’t be in the country.” Trump’s deportation policy, it would appear, now includes dissenting NFL wide receivers and running backs.

The politics of race, nationalism and sports have rarely been as deeply interconnected as they are right now.
The politics of race, nationalism and sports have rarely been as deeply interconnected as they are right now. For years, conservative pundits and sports fans alike have cried that “sports and politics don’t mix.” Yet with each Trumpian intervention, pronouncements insisting on the separation between politics and the games we love to watch and play become less credible. Though sports have always been a key site for wider ideological battles over what it means to be American, few presidents have inserted themselves into disputes within and about sports as directly as Trump has.

Trump’s actions last week ? his comments about the NFL’s new policy and his pardon of the boxer Jack Johnson ? are not, as some might think, a diversion from “real politics.” Rather, they are a prime example of Trumpian politics. First come the racially charged comments, which are followed by appeals to American exceptionalism and to the greatness of America. Then comes his attempt to present himself as deeply concerned with the plight of the dispossessed, particularly with African-American lives.

Whether through deliberate political strategy or nativist instinct, Trump understands that sports and politics are inseparable and can be useful for his political standing. Trump’s attacks on the NFL players are effective and resonant with his overwhelming white political base precisely because sports and politics are so tightly intertwined. No public arena in American life so clearly conflates militarism and nationalism, while centering black bodies at labor, as the commodified sports spectacle of the NFL. We should not be surprised that Trump ? “the First White President,” whose run for the presidency can be seen as the negation of the first black president ? has targeted black athletes for months now. He has long questioned their loyalty to “the flag” and their right to keep their jobs if they do not agree to perform patriotism for pay on the field. In this sense Trump is merely voicing the concerns and anxieties of large sections of white America who have felt threatened by the power, status and rising social mobility of professional black athletes: “shut up and play,” or rather now, “stand up, shut up, and play” being a way to make sure black athletes know their place. Recall his words last September during a campaign rally in Huntsville, Alabama: “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he’s fired.’” The crowd responded with chants of “USA! USA! USA!” That Trump would now question the citizenship rights of black athletes is the logical conclusion to his nationalist worldview. 

Trump’s pardon of African-American heavyweight champion Johnson ? only the third posthumous pardon in U.S. history ? should be seen in this light, too.

Trump was happy to point out that previous presidents, including Barack Obama, had failed to pardon Johnson when they had the chance but it was Trump who delivered justice. At the White House ceremony, Trump said the pardon “helps correct an injustice experienced by Jack Johnson. But it also reminds us of a racist past and how even today racist remarks and coded words are used to imperil African-Americans, especially black men, and to advance an un-American agenda.” Johnson, we should remember, was charged with “white slavery” under the Mann Act of 1912 in large part because wider society could not believe that the white women in Johnson’s entourage were there by choice. He must, they reasoned, have “enslaved” them and forcibly transported the women across state lines. 

Trump’s new-found interest in Johnson and the racism he endured is about as convincing as his repeated boasts of being proud to see the African-American unemployment rate at historic lows. As the journalist Dave Zirin noted, “There is little doubt that if Trump was alive in Jack Johnson’s day, he would’ve been one of his tormentors, not his savior. That’s what makes this pardon such cheap political theater. This isn’t justice. It’s trolling.”

Trump, if nothing else, reveals the true political meanings and nationalistic dictates of American sports. Thus we can now say, with some certainty, that the calls for “national unity” are actually calls to cover up racial disunity. The calls to “stand and salute the flag” are really calls to step back and stop thinking about the state of the nation. The calls to “respect the troops” are actually calls to endorse the Department of Defense and State Department’s policies and military adventures abroad.

Trump, if nothing else, reveals the true political meanings and nationalistic dictates of American sports.
Commentators who say all this “sports talk” is a distraction from “real politics” misunderstand what politics is in this moment. To discuss sports is not to avoid politics, because sports is politics. Nationalism is not apolitical, and playing the national anthem before every sporting event ? a rare practice elsewhere in the world ? is proof that sports have long been entwined with politics. To claim that sports and politics “don’t mix” is simply naive.

However, communities of color have a longer, older tradition than the founding of America as a nation-state. That is a tradition of resistance, contestation and rejection of the idea that “the flag” and the anthem represent a universal America, free of class conflict and racial oppression. Consider the earliest resistant struggles of Native Americans, or African-American orator Frederick Douglass’s bold declaration that “This Fourth of July is yours, not mine,” and the black national anthem, “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” These freedom struggles acknowledged that America’s national symbols were in fact those of white America. Supporting this radical tradition by rejecting the compulsory nationalism of American sports events is surely the more truly patriotic act.

7,"President Donald Trump dubiously suggested investigators from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe “will be meddling” in the upcoming midterm elections.

Trump tweeted Tuesday that “13 Angry Democrats” assigned to the investigation plan to attempt to interfere with the elections, most of which will be held on Nov. 6. As usual, he failed to mention that Mueller himself is a lifelong Republican. Although Trump has refused to firmly accept that Russia attempted to swing the 2016 presidential election in his favor ? as confirmed by the U.S. intelligence community in January 2017 ? he tweeted with certainty that Mueller’s investigators would tamper with the midterms.

There is zero evidence to suggest Trump’s statement is credible. However, in February, then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that Russia was already attempting to meddle in the midterms. He warned that the U.S. is no more prepared now than it was before the 2016 election to prevent Russian interference.

“Really, I think it’s just important to continue to say to Russia, ‘Look, if you think we don’t see what you’re doing, we do see it and you need to stop. If you don’t, you’re just going to continue to invite consequences for yourself,’” Tillerson told Fox News in February.

“I don’t know that I would say we are better prepared, because the Russians will adapt as well,” Tillerson said. “The point is, if it’s their intention to interfere, they are going to find ways to do that. We can take steps we can take, but this is something that, once they decide they are going to do it, it’s very difficult to pre-empt it.”

Trump has repeatedly attempted to smear the credibility of Mueller’s investigation. On Sunday, he lamented the “young and beautiful lives” supposedly “destroyed” by the “phony” Russia probe, tweeting that many of them “went back home in tatters.” It’s unclear who he was referring to in his tweet, but at least 19 people, including several of Trump’s former campaign associates, have been charged in the investigation.

Minutes after accusing Mueller’s investigators of election meddling, Trump tweeted Tuesday that he needed to “start focusing my energy” on other issues."
8,"Just the prospect of a peace deal appeared to boost Trump’s poll numbers. So what would a collapsed deal do? WASHINGTON ? While President Donald Trump may have seen a successful summit with North Korea’s dictator as the path to a Nobel Peace Prize, many leaders in the Republican Party had eyed a more practical benefit: an aid to retaining control of Congress.

Now, with the planned June 12 Singapore summit in off-again, on-again limbo, Republicans wonder if the initiative that had seemed like a godsend just a few weeks ago could instead turn into a curse.

“If it stays off, it’s bad,” said one top GOP fundraiser close to the White House, speaking on the condition of anonymity. He added that he personally never really bought the idea that a Trump meeting with Kim Jong Un would be a game-changer. “If he pulls it off, I don’t think it changes much other than building a narrative of success.”

Republican National Committee members gathered at the Trump golf resort in Doral, Florida, early this month, though, were far more sanguine about the positive effects a Trump-Kim meeting would have for their party in November. The gathering took place seven weeks following Trump’s sudden decision to accept Kim’s invitation to meet, and RNC members pointed to the president’s improved poll numbers thereafter as a sign for optimism.

Trump’s inflammatory statements about Kim ? on one occasion he promised to unleash “fire and fury” on North Korea if Kim threatened the United States ? had been among what Americans saw as the most unappealing aspects of Trump’s first year in office. His new willingness to sit down with Kim to work on a peace deal, RNC members believed, would boost his approval rating and make him far less of a drag on congressional Republicans trying to keep control of the House and Senate this November.

“If he pulls that off, it could be a red wave instead of a blue wave,” said one top RNC member attending the Florida meeting, also speaking on the condition of anonymity.

Still, it’s unclear how much actual help even a productive summit might give Republicans running for office this fall.

“There is no question the president is getting credit for pushing this process forward and starting a dialogue with North Korea,” said Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster. He said that benefit could linger even if a summit never comes together, even among independent voters. “If anything, it might move them more into Trump’s camp because they consider his actions good for the country.”

But Democratic pollster Peter Hart said Trump will continue to hurt Republican congressional candidates because he remains deeply unpopular with everyone but Republicans. “He has never had a job approval or a personal approval rating that matched the vote he got in 2016,” Hart said.

He added that even if the president were to conclude a breakthrough summit that moved North Korea closer to giving up its nuclear weapons, Trump, being Trump, would be unable to keep that accomplishment at the top of voters’ minds. “He will have 22,419 tweets between the summit and Election Day,” Hart said. “Too many events to allow him a free positive set of attitudes until November.”

One Republican adviser close to the Trump White House said it was “ridiculous” to think that lowered tensions with North Korea would push voters to support Republicans in any case.

“This is the problem with the RNC: They’re fucking morons,” the adviser said, adding that Republicans need to run on the threat of impeachment posed by a Democratic House. “If the party runs on North Korea and taxes? They’re going to lose 40 seats.”

Moreover, Chinese leaders, who have the most influence over Kim, are not going to permit a North Korea foreign policy win for Trump ahead of November, the adviser said. “Nothing was ever going to come out of Singapore. The Chinese were never going to let it happen,” the adviser said. “You think they want to help Trump in the midterms?”

John Weaver, the GOP political consultant who worked for Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s presidential bid in 2016, agreed that Republicans who believe a summit will help them are deluding themselves. “I don’t really hear that outside of the Beltway and the Trump cult,” he said, adding that people he speaks to are more worried that Trump, desperate for a deal, will get played by Kim.

“He doesn’t want to be briefed. He doesn’t read anything. He doesn’t want to tell anything to our allies. How do people think this is going to turn out?” Weaver said. “The North Koreans have already gotten more from him than they have for 30 years.”

9,"Caitlyn Jenner may have been an outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump since the early days of the 2016 election, but that doesn’t mean she’s thrilled with the way things have been going since then. 

In a Broadly profile published Tuesday, the transgender icon and former Olympian discussed her conservative politics and said Trump “has been, for all LGBT issues, the worst president we have ever had.” She also suggested she may not support his 2020 re-election campaign. 

“I want him to know politically I am disappointed, obviously,” Jenner said, pointing specifically to Trump’s rolling back of trans rights. “I don’t want our community to go backwards. Just leave us alone, that’s all we want.” 

Jenner’s Republican views have, of course, put her at odds with other LGBTQ people for some time. She’s met with U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, and says she believes the LGBTQ community stands to benefit from her decision to maintain a strong relationship with members of Trump’s Cabinet. 

“I think it’s good that I’m on the Republican side because the Republicans know that, and I have an immediate in with them to change their minds,” Jenner said.

“The Republicans need the most work when it comes to our issues, I get that,” she added. “I would rather work from the inside. I’m not the type of person who is going to stand on a street corner with a sign and jump up and down. No, I’m going to go have dinner with these people.”

Jenner said she’s also had “a great conversation” with Vice President Mike Pence, who has an established history of supporting anti-LGBTQ legislation. 

“He’s kinda like, from our standpoint, the real enemy. But that’s OK, I can handle that,” Jenner said. The vice president told her he “would love” to have a lengthier discussion down the line, she said.

In the nearly year and a half since Trump’s inauguration, Jenner has appeared critical of the administration’s policies in interviews and on social media.

She told Newsweek in March that she’d “built some very nice and good relationships with the Republican Party” but had not spoken with Trump himself.

200,"Ask people with deep knowledge of the US justice department about the damage Donald Trump might be doing to the country, and the conversation quickly flips back to Watergate.

Following Richard Nixon’s failed attempt to pull the plug on a special prosecutor who turned out to be on to something, the need for investigators to work free from White House interference was recognized by the public and reinforced by elected officials.


Donald Trump says North Korea summit on 12 June is back on

But now Trump is president, the public can seem apathetic or amnesiac and the norms governing justice department independence are being tested. Severely.

In interviews, two former assistant attorneys general, law professors and analysts from across the political spectrum used recurring words to describe Trump’s assault on justice: “dangerous”, “alarming”, “high-stakes”.

Some analysts warn that national security has also been endangered, as Trump has undermined public trust in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and intelligence agencies whose work is often conducted in secret and who therefore depend uniquely on such trust to function.

The question is whether Trump’s snips and snaps at the norms of justice department independence represent some greater dislocation: a constitutional crisis of some kind or even an erosion of the rule of law in America, as some commentators have posited.


In recent weeks, Trump has escalated his war on his perceived foes in the Department of Justice (DoJ), which hosts the office of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating alleged collusion between Moscow and Trump campaign officials.

That investigation, Trump has informed his Twitter followers, is the work of a “criminal deep state” engaged in a “WITCH HUNT” originally engineered by none other than Barack Obama.

If the Trump-supporting public is bothered by that kind of freewheeling conspiracy talk, there’s little sign of it. The president’s average approval rating is hovering close to 42%, pretty good for him. But others are deeply bothered by Trump’s seemingly nonstop provocations directed at the FBI, the attorney general, the intelligence apparatus and other DoJ agencies.

On Thursday, Trump casually granted a pardon to the race-baiting conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to campaign finance charges. The pardon was taken as a potential signal to former associates not to “flip” and cooperate with federal prosecutors – because even if they are convicted, a pardon may be waiting.

In an interview aboard Air Force One, the president mentioned he was considering pardoning other boldface names with “unfair” convictions.

“We’ve never had a president attack the intelligence and law enforcement agencies that work for him in this way,” Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor and former assistant attorney general under George W Bush, said in an email. “He’s attacking them in order to discredit the Mueller investigation. But the baleful impact on those agencies’ morale and on public trust in them unfortunately extends far beyond that investigation.”

While whispers of a “constitutional crisis” are in the air, many mainstream analyses reject that idea, pointing out among other things that the Mueller investigation continues full steam ahead, no matter how much Trump might whine about it. The bad news is that it doesn’t take a constitutional crisis to constitute a national emergency, said Eric Posner, a University of Chicago professor specializing in constitutional law.

“I think the problem with thinking about this in terms of crisis is that we should be concerned about what Trump is doing whether or not there ever is a crisis,” Posner said. “It’s perfectly possible, for example, that Trump could undermine Mueller’s investigation without causing a constitutional crisis.

 You could slide into an authoritarian regime without a real crisis ever taking place
Eric Posner, University of Chicago
“I think what people are worried about, when you look at other countries that have slid into authoritarianism, what has happened is that the leaders of those countries have proceeded incrementally, and so when he does some things initially that people didn’t resist, that enhances his power. Once he has more power he can do more things, take more action.

“And you could slide into an authoritarian regime without a real crisis ever taking place, and I think that’s what people should be focusing on.”

‘Things subtly changing’
Shortly after Trump’s election, Amy Siskind, a former Wall Street executive, started a website called The Weekly List, seeking to catalogue news stories documenting “eroding norms under the current regime”.

The site, which Siskind said gets up to a million visitors a week and which this year produced a book blurbed by current Trump target Samantha Bee, bears this tagline: “Experts in authoritarianism advise to keep a list of things subtly changing around you, so you’ll remember.”

“At my book events, again and again, people tell me ‘you’re keeping me sane’,” Siskind said. “There’s such an effort at gaslighting, that this is not happening. Then at the end of the week people are able to sit down and read all the things that happened.”

Two recent Trump provocations have proven particularly incendiary. First, he cooperated with Republican congressman Devin Nunes and others in a campaign that led to the disclosure of the identity of an FBI informant. Then, Trump ordered the justice department to investigate its own investigation – of him.

“I hereby demand,” Trump tweeted, “that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DoJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes – and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!”

David Kris, founder of Culper Partners consulting firm and a former assistant attorney general under Obama, warned that Trump’s continued assault on norms of justice department independence rose to the level of a threat to the rule of law.

“None of what we’re seeing in my view is at all normal and a lot of it is very dangerous,” said Kris.

“The norm of apolitical law enforcement, and the norm of intelligence activity under law, including honest bipartisan congressional oversight, as well as basic norms like conflict of interest and the White House staying out of particular investigations – all are essential elements of the even more fundamental value of the rule of law,” Kris said. “Which is itself essential to any modern functioning democracy. So the stakes are very high.”

Goldsmith, who has diagnosed and debunked ‘The Cycles of Panicked Reactions To Trump’, said that “there are bad things going on in our country” but that the infrastructure of justice was holding up so far.

“Despite Trump’s onslaught, his political appointees, all of whom he could fire, have continued to support the Mueller investigation fully and the investigation carries on to Trump’s intense displeasure,” Goldsmith wrote. “That is an amazing testament to justice department’s independence.

 Trump has certainly violated norms, but whether they erode will depend on what happens after Trump leaves
Jack Goldsmith, Harvard Law
“As for norms eroding, Trump has certainly violated norms, but whether they erode will depend on what happens after Trump leaves.”

The question of the elasticity of norms – will they bounce back or are they forever dented? – is one that occupies Kris and others.

“I think the answer depends a lot on what happens next,” Kris said. “I think we can count on President Trump to keep pushing as hard and as long as he can to do what he believes is in his self-interest regardless of these norms. And if in hindsight it is perceived that he ended badly in part because of that, then others will be deterred from using the same tactics in the future and we may even see a strengthening of some of these norms.

“This is what happened after President Nixon’s misconduct in Watergate, the rule of law and independent norms were strengthened.

“On the other hand, if Trump continues to profit, and is perceived in hindsight as having benefited from these quite radical norm violations, then we can expect future holders of the highest office of the land to engage in the sincerest form of flattery available.

“It depends, in short, on how this comes out. We’re engaged right now in a very high-stakes experiment.”"
201,"Donald Trump’s lawyers sent a private 20-page letter to the special counsel Robert Mueller to assert that he cannot be forced to testify in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, according to a report.

They also argue that Trump could not have committed obstruction because he has absolute authority over all federal investigations.

The existence of the letter sent in January was reported on Saturday by the New York Times, which posted a copy of the memo online. 

The memo is an assertion of presidential power and another front on which Trump’s lawyers have argued that he cannot be subpoenaed.

In the letter, the legal team argues that a charge of illegal obstruction is moot because the US constitution empowers the president to, “if he wished, terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon”.

In the letter, according to the New York Times, the president’s legal team write: “It is our understanding that the reason behind the request for the interview is to allow the special counsel’s office to complete its report.

“After reviewing the list of topics you presented, it is abundantly clear ... that all of the answers to your inquiries are contained in the exhibits and testimony that have already been voluntarily provided to you .... all of which clearly show that there was no collusion with Russia, and that no FBI investigation was or even could have been obstructed.

“It remains our position that the president’s actions here, by virtue of his position as the chief law enforcement officer, could neither constitutionally nor legally constitute obstruction because that would amount to him obstructing himself, and that he could, if he wished, terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon if he so desired.”

The memo goes on to say that the investigation has had the cooperation and backing of the president and White House despite it remaining a “burden” on him and the administration.

Trump has called the investigation a “witch-hunt” and on twitter on Saturday continued his attacks on the special counsel investigation."
202,"America’s farmers are about to start harvesting the wheat crop. Close to 60m tonnes are gathered annually and almost half is usually exported. Where this crop will be sold, though, remains an open question.

As Donald Trump’s trade war escalates, a lot of farmers are worried. Trump was elected, in part, on a promise to put America’s interests first and crack down on what he characterises as a world trade system rigged against the US. But until recently the president has acted like many of his predecessors – talking tough on the campaign trail but backtracking in the White House.

All that has changed. Week after week, Trump’s trade talk has seemed to harden. “One of the most concerning things is how this is escalating,” said David Salmonsen, the senior director for congressional relations at the American Farm Bureau Federation, one of US agriculture’s most powerful lobby groups.

As the harvesting season begins, China, Mexico, Canada and the EU are all threatening retaliation over Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminium. Agriculture is in the firing line.

Farmers are often the first to feel the hit in trade disputes that may not involve their own products, said Salmonsen. This time, the scale of the dispute could hardly be worse: US agricultural exports are worth about $140bn a year. Canada and Mexico import about $39bn worth, China’s share is $20bn and the EU around $12bn. All those countries have threatened retaliation over metal tariffs.

The dispute looks set to escalate. On or around 15 June, Trump will publish a list of $50bn worth of Chinese technology products to be hit with a 25% tariff. China is expected to hit back with a list of its own and US farmers expect they will be top of that list.

Negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) have turned toxic as Canada and Mexico decide how to retaliate. Nafta has been great for US agriculture: exports were just $8.9bn in 1993 before the agreement. “All we can say is, we hope this gets solved sooner rather than later,” said Salmonsen.

 It is just increasing tensions. Uncertainty is a huge factor
Jacqueline Varas, American Action Forum
The problem is that no one, perhaps not even Trump, seems to know what will happen next. Days after the US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said a trade war with China was “on hold”, the senior trade adviser Peter Navarro dismissed that comment as an “unfortunate soundbite”.

Senior Republicans including the House speaker, Paul Ryan, have called for Trump to rein in his rhetoric. Conservative economists are disappointed. “It is just increasing tensions,” said Jacqueline Varas, the director of immigration and trade policy at the conservative American Action Forum. “Uncertainty is a huge factor.”

For Trump, the disputes make good on his election promises but a trade war is likely to most affect some of the states that handed him the presidency. Canada and Mexico account for 70% of trade in Michigan, which is heavily dependent on the car industry. The state swung for Trump at the last election.

The situation is little better in reliably Republican Kentucky, the state with the second-greatest exposure to a trade war after Michigan, according to a report from Moody’s. Kentucky is not just another car manufacturing state: its bourbon industry is also facing international retaliation. According to the Kentucky Distillers’ Association, whiskey is worth $8.5bn to the state and supports 17,500 jobs.

It’s not just farmers bracing for icy trade winds. Bourbon, alongside Harley-Davidson and Levi’s jeans, is on an EU list of potential targets for tariffs. The targeting is clearly political: it can hardly be a coincidence that Harley-Davidson, for example, is headquartered in Wisconsin: another state where Republicans have a slim majority and face a tough battle in November’s midterm elections.

Trump’s trade policy has been mercurial, to say the least. Many are hoping that the war of words will prove no more than that. Steel and aluminium tariffs were slapped on China, Mexico, the EU, Australia and others, only to be removed, then replaced. Tough talk has been swapped for reconciliation, then swapped again.

“FAIR TRADE!” Trump tweeted last week. “Canada has treated our Agricultural business and Farmers very poorly for a very long period of time. Highly restrictive on Trade!”

While the president’s policy ­continues to sway like corn on a Iowa prairie, America’s farmers preparing for harvest are getting nervous.

“A lot of the talk so far has been about what might happen,” said Salmonsen. Now that matters are coming to a head: “June looks critical.”"
203,"Donald Trump has announced that a 12 June summit with Kim Jong-un will go ahead as planned in Singapore, saying it would mark the beginning of a negotiating process with North Korea that could involve several such meetings.

Trump was speaking to reporters after meeting Kim’s top aide, Kim Yong-chol, in the Oval Office. It had been billed as a brief courtesy visit but it continued for more than an hour and 20 minutes. In a lavish show of hospitality, Trump escorted his visitor, a former spy chief and general who is under US sanctions, outside the White House for more informal talks and to pose for photographs with the North Korean delegation.

Kim Yong-chol: the ultimate North Korean regime insider

Trump also appeared to accept the North Korean position that its denuclearisation would be a drawn-out process – not the all-in-one surrender of the regime’s nuclear arsenal that Trump officials had previously demanded.

“The big deal will be on June 12,” Trump said. “It’s a process, we’re not go in and sign something on June 12 and we never were. We are going to start a process. And I told them today: take your time. We can go fast, we can go slowly. I think they’d like to see something happen and if we can work something out that will be good.”

But in a dramatic downgrading of expectations from the summit, Trump said Singapore meeting would be a “getting-to-know-you meeting, plus”.

Such a meeting, the first ever between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, has been a longstanding objective of the Pyongyang regime. To achieve it, it has suspended nuclear and long-range missile tests, but has given no undertakings on the scale or speed of its nuclear disarmament.

On Friday night the US defence secretary, James Mattis, hinted at some of the agenda for the 12 June talks, saying the “separate and distinct” issue of America’s troop presence in South Korea would not be on the table and “nor should it be”. If diplomacy with North Korea worked, then troop levels and similar issues could come up, but only in discussions between the US and South Korea. “Our objective remains the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,” Mattis told the Shangri-La Dialogue, a security summit in Singapore.

North Korea has entered agreements several times before in which it has promised to disarm, but those agreements all collapsed.

In his remarks on Friday, Trump said that – although existing sanctions would stay in place – no new measures would be added, ditching the slogan that has defined his policy towards North Korea up to now.

“I don’t want to use the term maximum pressure any more,” Trump said. “We have hundreds of new sanctions ready to go ... but why would I do that when we’re talking so nicely?”

The president said that North Korea’s human rights record was not discussed in the meeting.

Kim Yong-chol, the first top North Korean official to visit the White House in 18 years, was met outside the West Wing by the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, and the head of the CIA Korea department, Andrew Kim, who ushered the 72-year-old regime veteran into the Oval Office to meet Trump.

Far from being hustled in through the back door of the White House, Kim was welcomed at the south lawn entrance in front of massed ranks of cameras and escorted to the Oval Office, where the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, was waiting with Trump.

The ceremonial arrival represented a propaganda coup for a regime that has endured decades of isolation.

The content of the letter was not immediately apparent. Trump at one point described it as “interesting” and then claimed not to have opened it.

“I may be in for a big surprise, folks,” he said.

The Wall Street Journal reported it simply expressed Kim’s interest in going ahead with the Singapore summit, and does not change North Korea’s negotiating positions.

Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, and Mike Pence, the vice-president – both hawks on North Korea – did not take part in the meeting and were nowhere to be seen before and after. Trump’s agreement to enter into a drawn-out negotiating process with North Korea, puts a question mark over Bolton’s future in the White House. He has insisted that any US agreement with Pyongyang would have to involve the regime’s unilateral and rapid surrender of its nuclear weapons programme, which Bolton referred to as the “Libyan model”.

The North Korean leader laid his position out during a visit by the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, on Thursday. Quoted by the state news agency, KCNA, Kim said “the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula will be solved on a stage-by-stage basis” in which each party addressed the interests of the other.

Vipin Narang, an expert on the North Korean nuclear weapons programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said it now appeared that Trump “seems to be ok with a stage-by-stage process”.

“It won’t result in disarmament but a lot of good can still happen,” Narang said.

The only other senior North Korean official ever to visit the White House was vice-marshal Jo Myong-rok, who delivered a letter to Bill Clinton from Kim Jong-un’s father, Kim Jong-il. That peace effort collapsed with the election weeks later of George W Bush, who cut off contacts with Pyongyang."
204,"Such a photograph would, it is fair to assume, have been beyond the most delirious, hallucinatory imaginings of a tropical fever patient five years ago. Donald Trump sits at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office with hands folded and a broad grin. To his right, dressed in black, stands an unsmiling Kim Kardashian West, a reality TV superstar catapulted to fame a decade ago by a sex tape.

“‘I broke the Internet.’ ‘I broke the country!’” parodied Comedy Central’s the Daily Show in response. The journalist Tom Gara of BuzzFeed News tweeted: “It’s amazing that the most powerful person in the world is just taking casual meetings with Trump like this.” And as preparations continue for talks with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, the NBC correspondent Peter Alexander posted: “The other Kim summit.”

Trump himself tweeted simply that it was a “great meeting” at which they “talked about prison reform and sentencing”, glazing over Kardashian’s somewhat dubious qualifications as a White House policy guru. But then, the 45th US president appears to have dispensed with expertise or a trusted inner circle. The doors of his Oval Office have been thrown open to the national security adviser one minute, a famous face from Keeping Up with the Kardashians the next.

 I think we’ve got a fuller picture of it now. He’s not a president who thinks he needs anybody
As Trump approaches 500 days in office, unleashing a daily barrage of remarks, tweets, insults, pardons and threats, teeing up a global trade war and chasing an on-off-on meeting with Kim, the restraints are off and the fabled “adults in the room” appear scarcer than ever. It is, critics say, not so much a team of rivals as a team of one. Donald Trump.

Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: “I think we’ve got a fuller picture of it now. He’s not a president who thinks he needs anybody. This is the ‘I’ presidency. You hear it in every speech and see it in every tweet: it’s always about himself. As in all things, his presidency will rise and fall on his own efforts.”

Once it was thought that rival White House factions would compete to shape the Trump presidency. But talk of a fight to the death between the “globalist-Goldman Sachs” wing and the “populist-nationalist” wing has faded into the background noise of individual egos. It’s now a war of all against all, multiple media reports suggest. A feud between the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and the trade adviser Peter Navarro, for example, is said to have erupted in a shouting match last month on the sidelines of trade talks in China.

According to the Axios website, Kelly Sadler, who had made a derogatory comment about the ailing senator John McCain, told Trump in front of colleagues that she thought her boss, Mercedes Schlapp, was one of the worst leakers in the White House. Schlapp “pushed back aggressively” and defended herself as the president looked on, Axios said.

Steele commented: “He gets almost a sadistic pleasure watching his staff form up camps, go after each other, tear each other down. What he did not expect from his business background was the leaks. There was one agenda at Trump Tower; there is not one agenda at the White House. What he’s learned is that people come into it with their own agenda. But by and large he gets his kicks from watching the staff behave like children on a playground.”

The list of departures is long and includes his communications director Hope Hicks, likened to a surrogate daughter, and his chief strategist Steve Bannon, likened to Thomas Cromwell in the court of Henry VIII. Neither has been replaced. “He’s his own communications director; that job is still vacant,” Steele added. “He’s his own chief strategist: he goes by his gut. He’s his own policy person: again he goes by his gut.”

In the past week alone, that gut instinct has led Trump to: slap hefty steel and aluminum tariffs on allies Canada, the European Union and Mexico, risking a global trade war; abruptly reinstate the Kim summit in Singapore on 12 June while saying, “I don’t want to use the term ‘maximum pressure’ any more”; accuse the New York Times of making up a source when in fact it was quoting a White House official who briefed numerous reporters; make 35 claims that were untrue at a rally in Nashville, according to a Washington Post count; declare that he wished he chose someone other than Jeff Sessions as attorney general; insist that he did not fire the FBI director James Comey over the Russia investigation, despite having admitted doing so in a TV interview, and continue to push his baseless “spygate” theory; and react to comedian Roseanne Barr’s racist joke with self-pity rather than condemnation.

 This is the first president in my memory who only listens to people who agree with him. I think it’s gotten worse
Then there was the curious episode of a presidential pardon for the conservative author and film-maker Dinesh D’Souza, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to violating federal campaign finance laws (and who once referred to Barack Obama as a “boy” from the “ghetto” ). The president also ruminated about pardons for the former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich and the TV personality Martha Stewart, both of whom had links to his show The Apprentice. It was widely speculated that he is sending a signal to aides questioned by the special Counsel Robert Mueller: stay loyal and all will be forgiven.

Typically a chief of staff would be expected to intervene and save a president from himself. John Kelly, who succeeded Reince Priebus in the job, never had much control over Trump’s Twitter finger and is now seen as a diminished force who no longer has the president’s ear. Even Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, seems a bit-part player these days.


By contrast, the newest faces in the West Wing have a reputation for reaffirming Trump and making him feel good about himself. His national security adviser, John Bolton, economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, and personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani seem to indulge rather than check their boss’s impulses.

 The satirist John Oliver has described Trump and his ally Rudy Giuliani as ‘basically two versions of the same person’.

Bob Shrum, a 74-year-old Democratic strategist, said: “This is the first president in my memory, including Richard Nixon, who only listens to people who agree with him. I think it’s gotten worse. If there’s any change, it’s in the direction of impulsive, unilateral, unconsidered decision making.”

Giuliani, a septuagenarian, thrice married New Yorker prone to incoherent interviews, and who has been working overtime to discredit Mueller, seems a natural fit. He and Trump are, the satirist John Oliver observed, “basically two versions of the same person.”

Gwenda Blair, a Trump biographer, said: “Trump is a salesman and now he has a deputy salesman. He doesn’t regard Giuliani as a rival; Giuliani is there specifically because he can get headlines and attention. Now Trump has two distraction machines: two spinning tops are much better than one. It doesn’t matter if they contradict themselves because they get two headlines.”

Trump’s management style is familiar from his decades as a chief executive in the cut-throat Manhattan property world, Blair added. “It’s what he always did: he’s the hub of the wheel and everyone else is a spoke. He sets everyone against each other and without overlapping duties so their only loyalty is to him. It’s constant upheaval: first someone is up, then they’re in the doghouse. He loves them and then he fires them. It’s what he’s done his whole career.”

She observed: “If you’re named Trump, you’re probably pretty safe, although there have been a couple of wives thrown under the bus.”"
205,"The European Union is set to strike back against Donald Trump’s “illegal” and “dangerous” steel tariffs.

Cecilia Malmstrom, the EU trade commissioner, announced the EU would be seeking to implement a number of retaliatory tariffs on American products by June 20.

The move comes after Mr Trump’s decision to impose a 25% duty on European steel and a 10% duty on European aluminium.

Ms Malmstrom accused Mr Trump of “playing a dangerous game” as she confirmed the EU would be taking “proportionate and measured” action against the US.


She said: “This is further weakening the transatlantic relations and it also increases the risk of severe turbulences in the markets globally.”

Ms Malmstrom said a final decision on what products would be hit with tariffs had not yet been made, but added that they would be from an already published list which includes the likes of Levi’s jeans, bourbon whiskey, cranberries and peanut butter.

She said: “We are not seeking to escalate any situation but we need to respond and we’ll do so in a measured manner, but not responding would be the same as accepting these tariffs which we consider are illegal.”

The commissioner refused to say Mr Trump had started a trade war, but said he had created a “very worrying situation”.

She said: “It could escalate and also the economic recovery that we have seen lately, notably in the European Union but globally, risks to be diminished by this.”

Mr Trump originally imposed the tariffs in March, saying a reliance on imported metals threatened national security.

But he exempted Canada, Mexico and the European Union to buy time for negotiations – a reprieve that expired at midnight on Thursday.

The director of trade body UK Steel, Gareth Stace, said he was “very, very worried” about the potential impact of a “double whammy” on British producers from the Trump administration’s decision.

UK steel producers could be shut out of an American market where they sold around £350 million of exports last year, while also facing increased competition from a “tsunami” of cheap steel diverted away from the US, he said.

Mr Stace told BBC Radio 4’s World At One that it was too early to speculate on the likely impact on jobs, but said: “At worst, we could fall straight back into the crisis we suffered in 2015/16, which was the worst steel crisis in a generation.

“We are heading for a trade war, which is going to be all losers – there will be no winners. The US economy will suffer as much as any other economy.”

Mr Stace said the EU should activate “safeguard measures” to prevent European markets being disrupted by a surge of as much as 25 million tonnes of steel diverted from the US.

Labour’s shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner earlier warned the UK Government to “strongly respond” to the move.

Mr Gardiner, speaking to Radio 4’s Today programme, said: “The president has said that he believes he could win a trade war, we think that a trade war is in nobody’s interests.”

He added: “We believe in a rules-based system, a multilateral system, President Trump doesn’t and we must understand that. He wants to break up that system.

“We have to respond strongly to it and make it clear to him that we’re not susceptible to the intimidation and the threats and the bullying that he’s putting in place.”

International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said in a statement that the UK would support any EU appeal to the WTO.

Dr Fox said: “I have been very clear these tariffs are not justified. We have not ruled out counter measures and will support any EU appeal to the WTO.

“But as the CBI have said, we do not want a trade war which does more to harm UK industries and consumers.”

Former White House press secretary Anthony Scaramucci, also speaking to Radio 4, said that with Mr Trump there was “always room for negotiation”."
